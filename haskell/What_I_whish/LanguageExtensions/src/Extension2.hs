{- ExtendedDefaultRules -}

-- When an ambiguous literal is typechecked, if at least one of its typeclass constraints is numeric and all of its classes are
-- standard library classes, the moduleâ€™s default list is consulted, and the first type from the list that will satisfy the context
-- of the type variable is instantiated.

-- default (C1 a,...,Cn a)

-- The following set of heuristics is used to determine what to instantiate the ambiguous type variable to.
-- 1. The type variable a appears in no other constraints
-- 2. All the classes Ci are standard.
-- 3. At least one of the classes Ci is numerical.
